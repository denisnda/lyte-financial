Our 6-Step SMSF Lending Process
A clear and compliant pathway designed for SMSF property lending
1. Initial SMSF Consultation

We begin with a detailed discussion to understand your SMSF’s objectives, the property you intend to purchase or refinance, and how this aligns with your long-term retirement strategy. During this conversation, we outline key SMSF borrowing rules and compliance considerations so the structure is correct from the very beginning.

2. Information Collection & SMSF Compliance Review

You’ll receive secure access to your Lyte Financial client portal to provide your SMSF trust deed, financials, contribution history, and other supporting documents. We then complete a thorough borrowing and compliance assessment to confirm the SMSF can legally borrow and identify the trust structure required. At this stage, we work closely with your accountant or SMSF administrator, as they are responsible for preparing or verifying the formal SMSF and trust documentation required for lending.

3. Strategy & Recommendation Meeting

Once our assessment is complete, we present a personalised SMSF lending strategy. This meeting outlines suitable lending options, the correct structure for the Bare Trust or Unit Trust arrangement, and the compliance pathway required for a successful purchase or refinance. It’s a collaborative discussion designed to give you full clarity on the process while ensuring your accountant or legal adviser is aligned with the structural requirements.

4. Structure Setup, Lending Proposal & Application Submission

You’ll receive a detailed lending proposal that outlines the lender, structure, repayments, and expected benefits. While your accountant or solicitor handles the setup or verification of the required entities — such as the Bare Trust/Holding Trust or Unit Trust — we coordinate with them to ensure the structure meets lender policy and SMSF borrowing rules. Once the structure is ready, we prepare and submit your SMSF lending application and manage communication with all parties to keep the process moving smoothly.

5. Loan Approval, Settlement & LRBA Completion

After approval, we guide you through the remaining requirements and oversee the Limited Recourse Borrowing Arrangement (LRBA) process. We liaise with your accountant, solicitor, the lender, and the property conveyancer to ensure all trust documents, trustee resolutions, and settlement steps are completed correctly. Our goal is to ensure a fully compliant, stress-free settlement so your SMSF can acquire the property confidently.

6. Ongoing Support, Reviews & SMSF Strategy Guidance

Our support continues beyond settlement. We provide ongoing loan reviews, rate check-ins, leasing guidance for related-party tenants (where applicable), and structural advice as SMSF lending rules evolve. We also continue working alongside your accountant or SMSF administrator to ensure the structure remains compliant, efficient, and aligned with your long-term superannuation strategy.
