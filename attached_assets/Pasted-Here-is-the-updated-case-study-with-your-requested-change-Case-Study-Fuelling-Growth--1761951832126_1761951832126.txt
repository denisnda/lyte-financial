## Case Study: Fuelling Growth with a 100% Financed $8.2M Premises

We believe smart financing is about more than just securing a loan; it's about creating a platform for your business to grow. This case study demonstrates how we helped a client preserve vital capital while securing their ideal commercial property.

### The Client's Goal

We were approached by a highly successful, established business that was rapidly outgrowing its current setup. The company was operating across **two separate leased premises**, which was inefficient and costly.

Their goal was to **consolidate operations** into a single, new, owner-occupied commercial property. However, they were concerned around the size of the deposit would drain their working capital needed for expansion.

### Our Strategic Solution

The client identified their ideal property, valued at **$8.2 million**.

Recognising the outstanding financial strength of the applicant, their strong personal income, and the company's consistent profitability, we devised a solution beyond the standard 70% or 80% loan.

We negotiated and structured a **100% finance facility for the entire $8.2 million purchase price**.

This was secured not against residential property, but against the business itself, using General Security Agreements (GSAs) over the trading entity. This structure was acceptable to the lender because we demonstrated the clear financial strength and serviceability of the client's business.

### The Tangible Outcome for Our Client 📈

By securing 100% of the purchase price, we delivered a powerful strategic advantage:

* **Zero Cash Deposit:** The client **preserved 100% of their cash reserves**. They did not have to tie up millions of dollars in a deposit.
* **Capital for Growth:** This preserved cash was immediately allocated to facilitating their business expansion, including **purchasing new equipment** and **boosting operational cash flow**.
* **A Platform for the Future:** Instead of just "buying a building," our solution enabled the client to take a major leap forward, securing their long-term premises *and* funding their growth, all in one move.

This is a prime example of how we partner with clients to find solutions that match their ambition.
