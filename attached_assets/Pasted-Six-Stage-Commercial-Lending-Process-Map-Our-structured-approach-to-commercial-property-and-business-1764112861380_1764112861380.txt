Six-Stage Commercial Lending Process Map
Our structured approach to commercial property and business finance
1. Initial Consultation & Needs Analysis

We begin with an in-depth discussion to understand your commercial goals, the purpose of the property purchase or refinance, and the broader financial requirements of your business. This includes reviewing current rental commitments, cash flow needs, business performance, and long-term operational plans. This stage ensures we clearly understand both your immediate objectives and the strategic drivers behind the transaction.

2. Information Collection & Preliminary Assessment

You’ll receive access to the Lyte Financial client portal to upload key documents such as business loan statements, financials, and property details. We assess borrowing capacity, analyse trading performance, evaluate security positions, and determine lender appetite for the scenario. This step allows us to identify opportunities, constraints, and structural requirements early in the process.

3. Strategy & Recommendation Session

Once our analysis is complete, we meet to present a tailored commercial lending strategy. During this session, we walk you through lender options, discuss structure pathways such as SPVs or trust entities, outline potential high-LVR solutions, and compare the impact of each scenario on cash flow and future growth. This collaborative session ensures full clarity and alignment before moving forward.

4. Structure Design & Application Submission

We finalise the ownership and borrowing structure — whether through a newly created SPV, an existing entity, or a trust arrangement — ensuring it aligns with your commercial objectives and lender policy. We then prepare and submit the commercial lending application, managing communication with lenders, accountants, solicitors, and valuers to ensure the submission is complete, accurate, and positioned for approval.

5. Approval, Settlement & Leaseback Execution

Following approval, we manage all outstanding requirements and coordinate directly with lenders, legal advisers, and relevant stakeholders to finalise the transaction. This includes overseeing valuations, completing entity documentation, and executing any required leaseback arrangements between the trading business and the SPV or property-holding entity. Our goal is a seamless, compliant settlement that supports both business operations and long-term property strategy.

6. Ongoing Support, Reviews & Strategic Guidance

Our partnership continues well beyond settlement. We provide ongoing rate reviews, facility assessments, structural optimisation, and strategic guidance as your business evolves. Whether planning expansion, future property acquisitions, refinancing, or restructuring of existing facilities, we ensure your commercial finance continues to support your growth, cash flow, and long-term business objectives.
