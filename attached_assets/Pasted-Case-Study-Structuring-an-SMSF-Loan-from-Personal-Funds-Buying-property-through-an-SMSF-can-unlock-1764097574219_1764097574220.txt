Case Study: Structuring an SMSF Loan from Personal Funds

Buying property through an SMSF can unlock powerful long-term wealth benefits, but the lending process can become complex when personal circumstances change. This case study shows how we helped the Client successfully purchase an investment property through their SMSF—even after their lender cancelled the pre-approval mid-process.

The Client’s Goal

The Client wanted to purchase an investment property through their Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF) as part of a long-term wealth-building strategy.

A pre-approval for an SMSF loan had already been secured under their PAYG income, and the Client was ready to proceed with the purchase.

The Challenge

During the transaction, the Client transitioned from PAYG employment to self-employment.

This created an immediate problem:

Lenders generally require two years of financials for self-employed borrowers, even for SMSF loans.

As a result, the lender cancelled the pre-approval, midway through the purchasing process.

Although the SMSF held some cash, it did not have enough to complete the full purchase price on its own.

Without a solution, the Client risked losing the investment opportunity.

Our Strategic Solution
1. Personal Loan to the SMSF to Complete the Purchase

We structured a compliant related-party loan, allowing the Client to lend money from their personal funds to the SMSF so it could complete the purchase in cash.

This preserved the transaction and met all SMSF regulatory obligations.

2. Refinancing the SMSF Property After 12 Months

Once the Client had sufficient trading history as a self-employed individual, we:

Re-engaged SMSF lenders

Secured a standard SMSF property loan

Rolled the related-party loan into the new SMSF loan

This returned the Client’s personal funds while keeping the structure fully compliant.

The Positive Outcome

A well-structured SMSF acquisition with full compliance and long-term benefits:

Successful Property Acquisition:
The SMSF completed the purchase on time, despite the cancelled pre-approval.

Personal Funds Returned:
The refinance allowed the Client to recover the full amount initially lent to the SMSF.

Compliance Assurance:
The related-party loan, SMSF transaction, and subsequent refinance were all
fully compliant, properly documented, and audit-approved, ensuring the integrity of the SMSF and meeting all regulatory requirements.

Long-Term SMSF Benefits:
The property is now held under the SMSF with a bank loan, providing tax efficiency and long-term asset growth.

Strategic Flexibility Maintained:
The Client continued their transition into self-employment without sacrificing investment momentum.
