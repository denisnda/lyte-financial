Case Study: Refinancing High-Rate SMSF Loans
How we helped clients reduce their SMSF loan rate by more than 1% despite major banks exiting the SMSF lending space

SMSF lending is often treated as a “set-and-forget” arrangement — but many trustees don’t realise their SMSF loan rates are significantly higher than necessary.
With most major banks withdrawing from SMSF lending, countless SMSFs are left on old, uncompetitive loan products that quietly erode long-term super balances.
This case study shows how we helped our client refinance their SMSF loan, reduce costs, and re-strengthen their long-term investment returns.

The Client’s Goal

The client held an existing SMSF property loan that had not been reviewed for several years. Their goals were simple:

Reduce their loan interest rate

Lower long-term costs inside their SMSF

Improve cash flow and investment returns

Ensure their SMSF structure remained compliant and sustainable

They suspected their interest rate was high — but had no idea how far the SMSF lending market had moved.

The Challenge

The SMSF lending landscape has changed dramatically:

Major banks have exited the SMSF lending space

Remaining lenders often have niche policies

Many SMSF loans automatically roll into high revert rates

Trustees typically don’t receive proactive rate reviews

Old SMSF products are often 1%–2% above market rates

The client’s existing loan was:

On an outdated SMSF product

Sitting over 1% above competitive rates

With no lender-driven review or repricing available

They needed a full refinance review — but SMSF lending requires strict compliance, a LRBA structure, trustee documentation, and a lender that still operates in this niche.

Our Strategic Solution
1. Full SMSF Lending Review

We reviewed the client’s:

Current LRBA structure

Trust deed and bare trust documents

Interest rate history

Repayment term and strategy

SMSF cash flow and investment plans

This confirmed the loan was significantly overpriced and suitable for refinance.

2. Identifying Active SMSF Lenders

Because most major banks no longer offer SMSF loans, we:

Assessed specialist SMSF lenders still active in the market

Compared rates, fees, and product structures

Matched their LRBA setup to lenders who accepted their trust documents

This ensured a smooth transition without structural issues.

3. Structuring the Refinance Correctly

SMSF refinancing requires precision. We:

Aligned the new lender’s requirements with the existing bare trust

Updated trustee documentation where necessary

Ensured compliance with SIS Act rules

Structured the loan to match the SMSF’s long-term investment horizon

4. Negotiating a Significantly Better Rate

We successfully secured a new SMSF loan that was:

Over 1% lower than their existing interest rate

On a modern, flexible SMSF lending product

With improved cash flow and long-term savings

This reduction alone increased the SMSF’s projected retirement value substantially.

5. Seamless Refinance & Settlement

We handled:

All lender communication

Document preparation

Trustee signatures

Settlement coordination

The refinance was completed without disruption to the SMSF’s investment property.

The Positive Outcome

✔ Interest rate reduced by more than 1%
A significant cost saving in an SMSF environment where every dollar compounds.

✔ Improved SMSF cash flow & long-term investment returns
Lower repayments mean more money stays invested for retirement growth.

✔ Modern, competitive SMSF loan structure
The client moved off an outdated product and onto a lender who still actively supports SMSF borrowers.

✔ Full compliance maintained
All LRBA and trustee documentation remained audit-ready.

✔ A long-term refinancing strategy in place
We set review intervals so the SMSF never drifts into an overpriced loan again.
