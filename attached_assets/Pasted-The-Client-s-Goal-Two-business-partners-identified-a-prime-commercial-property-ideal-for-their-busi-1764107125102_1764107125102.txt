The Client’s Goal

Two business partners identified a prime commercial property ideal for their business operations.
Their goal was to:

Purchase the property through their SMSFs — not personally

Avoid using personal cash or business cash flow

Secure long-term business stability by occupying a premises they indirectly own

Generate rental income back into their super funds

However, each partner held their own SMSF, and SMSFs cannot simply “co-own” property directly unless structured correctly.

The Challenge

Two separate SMSFs face strict rules around:

Joint property ownership

Related-party leases

Arm’s-length transactions

SMSF borrowing structures (LRBAs)

Asset segregation

The primary challenge:

How can two separate SMSFs legally and efficiently co-purchase one commercial property that their business will lease?

A direct co-ownership structure was not compliant or lender-friendly.
A structure needed to:

Allow equal ownership

Enable SMSF borrowing

Support a commercial lease to their own trading business

Remain fully compliant with SIS legislation

Be acceptable to lenders for LRBA lending

Our Strategic Solution
1. Establishing a Unit Trust

We worked with their accountant to establish a special-purpose Unit Trust designed solely to hold the commercial property.

This trust became the legal purchasing entity, simplifying ownership and lending.

2. Each SMSF Invests Into the Unit Trust

Each partner’s SMSF purchased 50% of the units in the trust.

This ensured:

Equal ownership

Clear reporting

A compliant investment

A structure lenders could work with

3. The Unit Trust Purchases the Property

With funds from both SMSFs and LRBA lending support, the Unit Trust acquired the commercial property.
Title was held by the trust, not the individuals or their business.

4. Commercial Leaseback to the Trading Business

Once settled, the client’s trading business moved into the property as the tenant.

We ensured the lease was structured:

At market rent

On arm’s-length terms

With SMSF compliance in mind

Suitable for audit and long-term planning

This ensured the SMSFs received regular rental income while the business secured a stable premises.

The Positive Outcome

✔ Two SMSFs successfully co-purchased a commercial property using a compliant and lender-approved Unit Trust structure
✔ No personal contributions or business cash were required to fund the property
✔ Business secured a high-quality premises with long-term stability
✔ Market-rate rent now flows into both SMSFs, improving retirement wealth
✔ A scalable, future-proof structure for future SMSF investments
✔ Full compliance with SIS Act, ATO audit requirements, and LRBA lending rules
