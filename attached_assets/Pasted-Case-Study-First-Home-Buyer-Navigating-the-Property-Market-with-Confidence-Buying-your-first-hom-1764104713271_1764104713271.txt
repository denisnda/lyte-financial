Case Study: First Home Buyer – Navigating the Property Market with Confidence

Buying your first home can feel overwhelming—especially when savings are limited and eligibility rules are unclear. This case study shows how we helped first-time buyers secure their home sooner and with minimal upfront costs.

The Client’s Goal

Clients: John & Barbara, Newcastle NSW
Goal: Purchase their first home with a low deposit and minimal upfront expenses.

They were ready to enter the property market but wanted clarity on:

How much they could borrow

Whether their deposit sources—including a small family gift—were acceptable to lenders

What government incentives they could access to reduce upfront costs

As first home buyers, they needed a clear path forward and expert guidance through a complex lending landscape.

The Client’s Challenge

John & Barbara had:

Strong, stable incomes

Limited savings

A portion of their deposit coming from a family gift

No prior knowledge of government schemes or lender requirements

They were unsure whether lenders would accept their deposit structure and did not want to miss out on a suitable property due to delays or uncertainty.
They needed a solution that maximised their borrowing power while minimising upfront costs.

Our Strategic Solution
1. Identifying Eligibility for the First Home Guarantee Scheme

We assessed the clients’ financial position and determined they were strong candidates for the First Home Guarantee, which allows eligible first-time buyers to purchase with just a 5% deposit and no LMI.

This immediately reduced their upfront contribution and accelerated their buying timeline.

2. Comprehensive Borrowing Capacity & Deposit Assessment

We completed a full borrowing analysis, considering:

Income stability

Liabilities

Living expenses

Deposit breakdown, including the family gift

We prepared a lender-ready explanation to ensure full clarity and compliance.

3. Managing the Guarantee Application & Lender Liaison

We coordinated all steps of the First Home Guarantee application, including:

Confirming their eligibility

Preparing documentation

Securing lender acceptance of the family-gift component

Fast-tracking the approval process

We also communicated directly with the lender, real estate agents, and conveyancer to keep the purchase moving efficiently.

4. End-to-End Support From Contract to Settlement

Throughout the transaction, we:

Reviewed and updated borrowing figures as required

Liaised with the conveyancer to align contract, deposit, and scheme requirements

Ensured the lender met all deadlines for approval and settlement

Provided ongoing guidance to give the clients full confidence at each stage

The Positive Outcome

A smooth first home purchase with significant cost savings:

✔ Approved and Settled Within 4 Weeks

The clients secured finance quickly, allowing them to proceed confidently with the purchase.

✔ Saved Approximately $12,000 in Lenders Mortgage Insurance

The First Home Guarantee eliminated LMI entirely, dramatically reducing upfront costs.

✔ Purchased With Only a 5% Deposit

Their savings and family gift were accepted without issue, simplifying the process.

✔ Moved Into Their New Home Sooner Than Expected

With reduced costs and a clear pathway, the clients were able to buy months earlier than they anticipated.

✔ A Confident Entry Into the Property Market

The clients received clear direction, lender support, and full guidance through a process that otherwise would have felt overwhelming.
