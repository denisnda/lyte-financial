## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **Framework:** React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Routing:** Wouter (lightweight React router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui component library (Radix UI primitives)
- **State Management:** TanStack React Query for server state
- **Build Tool:** Vite

**Design System:**
The application follows a professional financial services design language inspired by companies like Stripe and Wise:

- **Typography:** 
  - Display serif fonts (Playfair Display) for headlines and emphasis
  - Clean sans-serif (Inter, Open Sans) for body content
  - Hierarchical scaling from 3xl-6xl for headings

- **Color Palette:**
  - Primary Navy (#1a2332) - headers, cards, primary text
  - Soft Beige/Cream (#e8dcc4) - CTAs and accents
  - Neutral grays for backgrounds and borders
  - CSS custom properties for theme consistency

- **Component Patterns:**
  - Card-based layouts with rounded corners and subtle shadows
  - Hero sections with gradient overlays on professional imagery
  - Multi-stage flow visualizations for process documentation
  - Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale (4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32)

**Page Structure:**
The application uses a route-based architecture with the following main pages:
- Home: Landing page with service overview
- Business Purchase: Business lending information and case studies
- Commercial Property: Commercial financing solutions
- SMSF Lending: Self-managed super fund property investment
- Residential Lending: Home loan solutions
- Process pages: Step-by-step lending processes for each service type
- Scenario pages: Real-world case studies
- Contact: Client inquiry form
- Team: Team member information

**Component Organization:**
- Reusable UI components in `/client/src/components/ui/` (Shadcn components)
- Feature components in `/client/src/components/` (Header, HeroSection, CTASection, etc.)
- Page components in `/client/src/pages/`
- Shared TypeScript types in `/shared/`

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **Runtime:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database ORM:** Drizzle ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Neon serverless)
- **Build Tool:** esbuild for production bundling
- **Development:** tsx for TypeScript execution

**API Architecture:**
The backend follows a minimal API server pattern:
- Express server handles API routes (prefixed with `/api`)
- Vite dev server middleware for development hot-reload
- Static file serving for production builds
- Request/response logging middleware
- Storage abstraction layer for database operations

**Data Layer:**
- Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database operations
- Schema definitions in `/shared/schema.ts`
- Database migrations in `/migrations/`
- In-memory storage implementation (`MemStorage`) for development/testing
- Abstract storage interface (`IStorage`) allows swapping implementations

**Current Schema:**
- `users` table with id, username, password fields
- UUID-based primary keys
- Prepared for expansion with additional business entities

### External Dependencies

**Third-Party UI Libraries:**
- Radix UI primitives (accordion, dialog, dropdown, navigation, toast, etc.)
- Embla Carousel for image/content carousels
- Lucide React for iconography
- class-variance-authority (CVA) for component variant management
- cmdk for command palette interfaces

**Development Tools:**
- Vite plugins for development experience:
  - Runtime error overlay (@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal)
  - Cartographer for code navigation (@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer)
  - Development banner (@replit/vite-plugin-dev-banner)

**Form Handling:**
- React Hook Form with Zod validation
- @hookform/resolvers for validation schema integration
- drizzle-zod for automatic Zod schema generation from database schemas

**Database:**
- Neon serverless PostgreSQL (@neondatabase/serverless)
- Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- connect-pg-simple for session storage (prepared but not actively used)

**Styling & Utilities:**
- Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- clsx and tailwind-merge for className management
- date-fns for date manipulation

**Asset Management:**
- Professional business imagery in `/attached_assets/`
- Logo and hero images referenced via Vite's asset handling
- Generated images for scenarios and hero sections

**Notable Architectural Decisions:**

1. **Monorepo Structure:** Single repository with client, server, and shared code for simplified development and type sharing
2. **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode enabled
3. **Component Library:** Shadcn/ui chosen for customizable, accessible components that don't abstract away implementation details
4. **Lightweight Routing:** Wouter selected over React Router for smaller bundle size
5. **Server-Side Integration:** Vite middleware mode allows seamless development experience with Express API
6. **Design Token System:** CSS custom properties enable theme consistency and potential dark mode support
7. **Storage Abstraction:** Interface-based storage layer enables easy transition from in-memory to PostgreSQL without changing application code
